> Integrating Human–Computer Interaction principles into next-gen diet-planning apps.

## 📄 Abstract

In this project we explore an HCI-driven approach to diet-planning applications. We conducted two design iterations:

1. **Needfinding & Heuristic Evaluation**  
   • Semi-structured interviews, surveys, and Nielsen-heuristic reviews of MyFitnessPal, Yazio, and Cronometer.  
   • Key insights:  
     - Meal-logging is too manual and time-consuming  
     - Users crave personalized suggestions  
     - Motivation drives long-term adoption  

2. **Brainstorming & Prototyping**  
   • Generated 48 ideas (29 manual + 19 via ChatGPT), clustered by our three core insights.  
   • Selected top concepts for low-fidelity prototypes:  
     - **Quick-Add Meal Tracker** (frictionless logging in ≤3 taps)  
     - **Smart Meal Swap** (on-the-fly, goal-aware ingredient swaps)  
     - **Progress Milestone Badges** (gamified streaks & social sharing)

## 📝 Introduction

NutriPath is our team’s attempt to rethink diet-planning UX by:

- **Simplifying** everyday meal tracking  
- **Personalizing** recommendations to each user’s context  
- **Motivating** long-term adherence through gamification  

We build on HCI best practices—direct manipulation, visibility, minimal cognitive load—to deliver an interface that’s both powerful and delightful.

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Simplify Tracking**  
   Logging 15+ items per day emerges as a major friction point.  
2. **Deep Personalization**  
   Dietary preferences, allergies, budgets, and routines vary widely.  
3. **Boost Motivation**  
   Habit formation falters without clear, rewarding feedback loops.

## 🖼️ Prototypes

1. **Quick-Add Meal Tracker**  
   - Tap a “favorite” meal card to log in one step  
   - Long-press to customize portions or macros  

2. **Smart Meal Swap**  
   - Swap high-carb or high-fat ingredients with one tap  
   - “Why this?” tooltips explain each suggestion  

3. **Progress Milestone Badges**  
   - Unlock streak badges (e.g. “7-Day Logging”)  
   - Share achievements via social or in-app feed  

_Sketches and flows are available in the `prototype/` directory._
